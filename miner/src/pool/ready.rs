//! Transaction Readiness indicator
//!
//! Transaction readiness is responsible for indicating if
//! particular transaction can be included in the block.
//!
//! Regular transactions are ready iff the current state nonce
//! (obtained from `StateClient`) equals to the transaction nonce.
//!
//! Let's define `S = state nonce`. Transactions are processed
//! in order, so we first include transaction with nonce `S`,
//! but then we are able to include the one with `S + 1` nonce.
//! So bear in mind that transactions can be included in chains
//! and their readiness is dependent on previous transactions from
//! the same sender.
//!
//! There are three possible outcomes:
//! - The transaction is old (stalled; state nonce < transaction nonce)
//! - The transaction is ready (current; state nonce == transaction nonce)
//! - The transaction is not ready yet (future; state nonce > transaction nonce)
//!
//! NOTE The transactions are always checked for readines in order they are stored within the queue.
//! First `Readiness::Future` response also causes all subsequent transactions from the same sender
//! to be marked as `Future`.
